                    HTML is an examples of a computer language that is NOT a programming language.  It is a markup language.  The different between a programming language and a markup language is like the different between gears and bricks.  You can build stuff out of bricks, but they can perform no complex funtions.  The basic structure of a webpage is made using HTML.  To created a webpage with any more complicated functions, you need to also use another language such as PHP or Javascript.

                    <del>Here</del> you can <b>see</b> <sup>me</sup> showing <em>off</em> what I can do with <button type="button">html</button>.

                    The new tags I used in this website include del, sup, and button.

                    Related to HTML is CSS.  Which is a language used for changing the style of a webpage.

                    <div id="Example">Here you can see me showing off some CSS.  Using the background-image, outline, and padding properties.</div>
                    <br />
