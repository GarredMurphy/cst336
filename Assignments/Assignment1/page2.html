                    The first thing to know is do not confuse Java with Javascript.  They are very different from each other and aren't even related to each other and are used for very different things.  Programs that are writen in java run in a virtual machine.  Javascript runs in a browser and doesn't need to be compiled.  Java is used for many different aplication.  The java programing language is very useful because any computer can run java programs as long as they have Java installed.  The Java language looks very similar to C++ but improves on it in several ways to make it easier to use.
